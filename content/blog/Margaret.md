I was born in Wales to an English/Welsh mother and Irish father, but then moved to the edge of London for a couple of years before the family emigrated to Western Australia when I was five and a half years old.  Due to Dad’s many changes in employment, we moved around somewhat changing houses and schools.  Sometimes living in the suburbs, sometimes more rural and for a few years, when Dad was a lighthouse keeper, on an Island where there was no school and correspondence lessons were done.

Dad always had an agricultural interest, so no matter where we were we had animals and vegetable gardens, and I guess the experiences of the places we had lived and the lifestyle fostered an appreciation and love of things of nature and being outside.

Marrying [David](/blog/david) in 1970 encouraged more interest and enjoyment in the beauty of the natural world around us as he would point out the intricacies of designs in both plant, insect and animal life, and the curious habits of different creatures. Both in our work (running a wholesale plant production nursery) or on holidays, we were always surrounded by nature.

God was always a big part of my life and as I considered the attributes of life around me, I stood in awe of the God who designed them.  My photography came late and is of a very basic nature compared to David’s.

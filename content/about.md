Growing up in Australia with a love of the outdoors and nature there were many things which aroused my curiosity. Western society today generally accepts the theory of evolution as a fact, but for the inquiring mind there are some unusual, yes, curious things that have stimulated my mind to explore a little deeper.

Hence I have called this website *A Curious World*.

It is a privilege to be living in an age of modern travel and technology, and to be able to explore the world we live in and record photographic images of the beauty and complexity of nature around us.

I trust you will enjoy this website and that it will encourage you to look closer and discover for yourself more amazing creatures and landscapes, their origins and purposes.

> Thus says God the Lord, Who created the heavens
and stretched them out, Who spread forth the earth
and that which comes from it, Who gives breath to
the people on it, And spirit to those who walk on it.

Isaiah 42:4-6 Holy Bible (New King James Version)

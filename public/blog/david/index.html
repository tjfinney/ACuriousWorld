<p>I was brought up in a religion that was really more like a cult with many strict rules and regulations. Primary school years were many happy times, with friends and family, but high school years were a nightmare of embarrassment trying to live by rules.</p>

<p>A great love of the outdoors, the bush, the beach, the outback, snorkeling, exploring caves, wildflowers and critters, climbing trees looking for bird’s nests, animals, birds, lizards and snakes, being cooped up in a religion that was cultish wasn’t for me!</p>

<p>My first part time job, in school holidays, delivering telegrams by pushbike around the streets of Perth gave me enough money to buy a ‘Brownie‘ box camera, and the interest in recording photographic images began.</p>

<p>At sixteen I dropped out of 4th year (now Year 11) high school and organized employment on a farm to get away from the restrictions, confusion, guilt and pressure to conform.  My father got wind of my plans, put a spanner in the works and promptly found me a job in a local nursery &ndash; so began a life of propagating plants.</p>

<p>During the Vietnam War, 20 year old males had their birthdates drawn out of a barrel to be conscripted into the Australian Army.  The only draw of any significance I have ever won &ndash; Two Years in National Service!</p>

<p>Ten weeks basic training and ten weeks corps training and the army turned me into a Theatre assistant assisting in operations on wounded soldiers from Vietnam. Exposed to life in the raw, but it seemed like an unseen power kept me from getting into trouble.</p>

<p><img src="img/blog/David/David-and-Margaret.png" alt="David and Margaret" /></p>

<p>Having been officially “withdrawn from” and excommunicated by my church and family, I was not allowed to return home after my time in National Service.  Some kind generous friends took me into their home and family.  Through this family, I was introduced to many young friends who impacted my life by their exemplary Christian character and enjoyment of life.  Yes, you have probably guessed it by now, I stole the heart of <a href="https://acuriousworld.netlify.com/blog/margaret">one of the young girls</a> there and she has spent the time since working hard beside me, building a Nursery and raising four children and accompanying me on many adventures, sometimes nervously, but always enjoying it.</p>

<p>Life has been good.</p>

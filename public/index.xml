      <description>I was born in Wales to an English/Welsh mother and Irish father, but then moved to the edge of London for a couple of years before the family emigrated to Western Australia when I was five and a half years old. Due to Dad’s many changes in employment, we moved around somewhat changing houses and schools. Sometimes living in the suburbs, sometimes more rural and for a few years, when Dad was a lighthouse keeper, on an Island where there was no school and correspondence lessons were done.</description>

      <description>I was brought up in a religion that was really more like a cult with many strict rules and regulations. Primary school years were many happy times, with friends and family, but high school years were a nightmare of embarrassment trying to live by rules.
A great love of the outdoors, the bush, the beach, the outback, snorkeling, exploring caves, wildflowers and critters, climbing trees looking for bird’s nests, animals, birds, lizards and snakes, being cooped up in a religion that was cultish wasn’t for me!</description>

      <description>Growing up in Australia with a love of the outdoors and nature there were many things which aroused my curiosity. Western society today generally accepts the theory of evolution as a fact, but for the inquiring mind there are some unusual, yes, curious things that have stimulated my mind to explore a little deeper.
Hence I have called this website A Curious World.
It is a privilege to be living in an age of modern travel and technology, and to be able to explore the world we live in and record photographic images of the beauty and complexity of nature around us.</description>
